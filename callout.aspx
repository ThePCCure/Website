    <p class="Header center">The PC Cure Call Out.</p>
    <p>The PC Cure offer a call out service. We know that it is not always convenient or even possible to get your computer to us so we can come to you. Whether you work in an office or just need your home computer fixed, this service is available to you. </p>
    <p>Obviously it is not always possible to fix all problems on location, hence we may have to take the computer back to our workshop for repair. </p>
