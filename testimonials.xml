    <worktype>new Build</worktype>
    <message>I've waited a little while to write this review so I knew everything was working well.

Had some trouble building a new PC so called Shane to help. I was so pleased by this thoroughness that I asked him to help build the rest of it. He also made sure the latest drivers were installed so it was just a case of putting my software on.

He's a really nice guy who didn't charge extra when he worked a tiny bit over the hour mark, which was a nice surprise!

Overall, i'd really recommend him if you need help with a PC, I've already got another job in mind for him!</message>
